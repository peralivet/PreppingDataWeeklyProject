This is a project from TheForage. I'm working on a Call Center data set. Here is the link to the [Power BI Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZWRmMTgwNjQtYjY1ZC00OTllLTlkZTctN2ZjYjMxY2IxYTYyIiwidCI6IjczOWFhMmE3LTFiMzktNGIzNS1iNTEzLTQ1NjY5MzQ3YjFjYSJ9) for my solution.

The steps taken in solving this problem are in the Process.md file.

Here is the requirement.

### Introduction 

May I introduce myself? I'm Claire, Call Centre Manager here at PhoneNow. My colleague suggested I reach out to you. Pleased to meet you.

I'm looking for transparency and insight into the data we have here at the Call Centre. For example: total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, overall customer satisfaction, etc. What I'm after is an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour.
I was told you are great at visualising data in such a way that important aspects become very clear. That's precisely what I need.

Could you please prepare a dashboard on Call Centre trends that I can use as a basis for discussion with management? I'lI provide you with the required data, of course.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Claire

### Dashboard

Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative!
Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):
    - Overall customer satisfaction
    - Overall calls answered/abandoned
    - Calls by time
    - Average speed of answer
    - Agent's performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
