#### File import

> I'm using the Get Data feature in PowerBI to import the input files(Swift Code and Transaction) into the work environment.

#### Data Modeling

> I will do a bit of data modelling here because the two files that are now tables(model) have a common field between them which links them together.
  > Transaction table contains the Bank column which is a primary key in the Swift Code table so that a link will be made between them in the data model view of PowerBI
