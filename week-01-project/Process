1. I uploaded all the input files into PowerBI and I'm using the Power Query Feature in PowerBI to Clean the data
2. I want to normalize the data a bit and here are some of the things I'm doing:
   a. Creating a new table called Store, it will contain the store ID and the Store Name(i.e. Wimbledon)
   b. Add the store ID to each existing data(the various tables;Wimbledon and Clapham)
   c. I used a DAX code to create a custom column for each table by selecting the various day each table belong to:
         SaleDate =  CALCULATE(
                               MAX(Dates[Dates]),
                               FILTER(Dates, WEEKDAY(Dates[Dates], 2) = 3)
                              )
     The DAX code above is creating a new column that will filter the Date table for the day of the week which is a Tuesday then the matching 
      date will be added to the Clapham and Wimbledon table which is a Tuesday. Same process for the rest of the week.
3. Combine the various Wimbledon data into just one table "Wimbledon" and remove duplicates using the following Dax code
   (
         Wimbledon = DISTINCT(
                         //This will create a new Wimbledon table and will eliminate Duplicate rows
                        UNION('Wimbledon Fri','Wimbledon Mon','Wimbledon Tues','Wimbledon Wed','Wimbledon Thurs')
                           ))
4. Combine the various Wimbledon data into just one table "Clapham" and remove duplicates using the following Dax code
   (
        Clapham = DISTINCT(
                         //This will create a new Clapham table and will eliminate Duplicate rows
                        UNION('Clapham Mon','Clapham Tues','Clapham Wed','Clapham Thurs','Clapham Fri')
                           )
)
