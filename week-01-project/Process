1. I uploaded all the input files into Power BI, and I'm using the Power Query feature in Power BI to clean the data.
2. I  want to normalize the data a bit, and here are some of the things I'm doing:
      a. Creating a new table called "Store," which will contain the store ID and the store name (e.g., Wimbledon).
      b. Adding the store ID to each existing dataset (the various tables: Wimbledon and Clapham).
   c. I used a DAX code to create a custom column for each table by selecting the various day each table belong to:
         SaleDate =  CALCULATE(
                               MAX(Dates[Dates]),
                               FILTER(Dates, WEEKDAY(Dates[Dates], 2) = 3)
                              )
     The DAX code above is creating a new column that will filter the Date table for the day of the week which is a Tuesday then the matching 
      date will be added to the Clapham and Wimbledon table which is a Tuesday. Same process for the rest of the week.
3. Combine the various Wimbledon data into just one table "Wimbledon" and remove duplicates using the following Dax code
   (
         Wimbledon = DISTINCT(
                         //This will create a new Wimbledon table and will eliminate Duplicate rows
                        UNION('Wimbledon Fri','Wimbledon Mon','Wimbledon Tues','Wimbledon Wed','Wimbledon Thurs')
                           ))
4. Combine the various Wimbledon data into just one table "Clapham" and remove duplicates using the following Dax code
   (
        Clapham = DISTINCT(
                         //This will create a new Clapham table and will eliminate Duplicate rows
                        UNION('Clapham Mon','Clapham Tues','Clapham Wed','Clapham Thurs','Clapham Fri')
                           )
)

5. I combined both Wimbledon and Clapham tables using this Dax Code: Both Tables = UNION(Wimbledon,Clapham)
6. To solve this, 1. Scent 
                     - 20 rows (21 rows including headers)
                     - 4 columns:
                     Store 
                     Date
                     Scent % of Store Sales Volumes
                     Scent % of Store Sales Values

I created a measure for the  Scent % of Store Sales Volumes using this dax code: 
   Scent % of Store Sales Volumes = 
   DIVIDE(
       SUM('Both Tables'[Sales Volume]),
       CALCULATE(
           SUM('Both Tables'[Sales Volume]),
           ALL('Both Tables'[Scent])
       ),
       0
   )

I created a measure for the  Scent % of Store Sales Value using this dax code:
Scent % of Store Sales Values = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM('Both Tables'[Sales Value]),
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('Both Tables'[Sales Value]),
        ALL('Both Tables'[Scent])
    ),
    0
)

7. To solve this,
               2. Weekday 
               - 10 rows (11 rows including headers)
               - 4 columns:
               Store 
               Date
               Weekday % of Store Sales Volumes
               Weekday % of Store Sales Values

I created a measure for the Weekday % of Store Sales Volumes using this dax code:
    Scent % of Store Sales Volumes = 
                     DIVIDE(
                         SUM('Both Tables'[Sales Volume]),
                         CALCULATE(
                             SUM('Both Tables'[Sales Volume]),
                             ALL('Both Tables'[Scent])
                         ),
                         0
                     )

I created a measure for the Weekday % of Store Sales value using this Dax code:
   Scent % of Store Sales Values = 
                     DIVIDE(
                         SUM('Both Tables'[Sales Value]),
                         CALCULATE(
                             SUM('Both Tables'[Sales Value]),
                             ALL('Both Tables'[Scent])
                         ),
                         0
                     )
