Data is everywhere and often in annoyingly small files that we need to piece together before we can begin analysis; Chin & Beard Suds Co is no different.

This week's challenge is to piece together data we have received from our Clapham and Wimbledon stores. We've heard there are lots of differences between our two stores in South West London for Sales Volumes and Values. We've heard there are duplicates in the dataset so help us remove these as the entries are the same, just doubled up due to some reporting issues.

Input all Data Files
Remove Duplicates (identical rows)
Work out the percentage of:
Scent sales per Store's Total Sales Values and Volumes
Weekday sales per Store Total Sales Values and Volumes
Replace Weekday with full date
Output Data


1. Scent 
- 20 rows (21 rows including headers)
- 4 columns:
Store 
Date
Scent % of Store Sales Volumes
Scent % of Store Sales Values


2. Weekday 
- 10 rows (11 rows including headers)
- 4 columns:
Store 
Date
Weekday % of Store Sales Volumes
Weekday % of Store Sales Values
